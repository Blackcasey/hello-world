# hello-world
Playing around with creating a repository on GitHub.
Hey, What's up? I'm Casey. I've created a GitHub account to connect with developers and programmers.
I'm pursuing an associates degree in computer programming at lone star college and thought this would be a 
great way to make a splash in IT.
